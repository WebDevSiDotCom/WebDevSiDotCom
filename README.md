Hi! I'm Web Dev Si 

I am a developer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and responsive websites. 

My skills include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Angular, SQL, Python (beginner level), and I'm always learning more (currently exploring GraphQL).

I am always looking to expand my knowledge and improve my skills, and I enjoy sharing my work with others. 

Feel free to take a look at my projects and let me know what you think!

You can view my portfolio at [webdevsi.com](https://webdevsi.com) (coming soon!) or contact me at [webdevsi@pm.me](mailto:webdevsi@pm.me)
